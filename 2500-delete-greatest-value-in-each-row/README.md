<h2><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-greatest-value-in-each-row/">2500. Delete Greatest Value in Each Row</a></h2><h3>Easy</h3><hr><div><p>You are given an <code>m x n</code> matrix <code>grid</code> consisting of positive integers.</p>

<p>Perform the following operation until <code>grid</code> becomes empty:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Delete the element with the greatest value from each row. If multiple such elements exist, delete any of them.</li>
	<li>Add the maximum of deleted elements to the answer.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note</strong> that the number of columns decreases by one after each operation.</p>

<p>Return <em>the answer after performing the operations described above</em>.</p>

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> grid = [[1,2,4],[3,3,1]]
<strong>Output:</strong> 8
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The diagram above shows the removed values in each step.
- In the first operation, we remove 4 from the first row and 3 from the second row (notice that, there are two cells with value 3 and we can remove any of them). We add 4 to the answer.
- In the second operation, we remove 2 from the first row and 3 from the second row. We add 3 to the answer.
- In the third operation, we remove 1 from the first row and 1 from the second row. We add 1 to the answer.
The final answer = 4 + 3 + 1 = 8.

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> grid = [[10]]
<strong>Output:</strong> 10
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The diagram above shows the removed values in each step.
- In the first operation, we remove 10 from the first row. We add 10 to the answer.
The final answer = 10.
